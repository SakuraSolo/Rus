"""Rowan Blackwell was the only son of a hunter couple who lived in the Western Forest, nearby Arthdale in Rosaria.  When he was nine, his parents were killed by the monsters in the forest and the village elder of Arthdale took him in.  There he met Alexia and the two became sweethearts.

When the chaos war broke out in 868 A.F., Rowan was levied into the Rosarian army at the age of seventeen.  Shortly afterwards he was sent to join the garrison at the Northern Rosarian keep of Karst.  When the keep feel under attack and the commander (duke Werden) was killed, Rowan took command after the rest of the nobility fled and held out for four months before reinforcements arrived, earning him the moniker, "The hero of Karst".

He would later be recruited by Deanara into her party of heroes from the Six Realms.  Together they would lead the war and undermine Karnas's efforts.  Eventually they confronted him in Bloodmeen and ended his life.

After the war ended, Rowan returned to Arthdale and married his childhood sweetheart, Alexia.  Since then, they have lived in peace together.  He is sometimes called to events or ceremonies hosted by the nobility due to his status as a hero, but both prefer to leave each other be when possible.

        'alexia_starting': ('Characters', 'Alexia Blackwell',
"""Alexia was born to a family of bakers, in the town of Arthdale in the realm of Rosaria.  Her upbringing was typical for a Rosarian peasant women.  She formed a close relationship with a boy named Rowan who'd been taken in by the village elder, who lived in the general store next door.

After Rowan was called away by the war, she remained behind in Arthdale.  During this time she continued to train her skills as a housewife, hoping that her darling would return to her when the war ended.  As tales of his heroics trickled back to the village, she found herself filled with hope, trepidation, and fear.  A hero might die at any time, and there'd be countless women fawning over him while he was away.

She was overjoyed when her beloved returned to her after the war ended.  She could hardly believe that such a great hero had done so, but thanked Solensia every day for being so blessed.

Many who meet Alexia are surprised that the wife of a hero is in almost all respects an ordinary, though beautiful, woman.  She has little to no ambition beyond marrying Rowan and raising a family with him.  Oftentimes she ends up being ignored by nobility and other upper members of society, usually not being invited to official events when her husband is.

"""The village elder of Arthdale is a very respected member of the community who previously ran the general store next to the bakery with his wife Meris.  The two were married for fifty years before Meris's death, but never had any children of their own.  After Rowan's parents died, he took the boy in and raised him as his own until the war of chaos broke out.

After the war ended he finally retired from his work at the store in his seventies, spending the rest of his time relaxing and offering advice to those he met on his regular walks around the village.  Rowan still sees him as a father figure and close friend.

The elder's actual name is Travis Potts, but no one can ever remember what it is and he prefers if they just call him "friend" instead.

Jezera has a natural affinity for manipulation and intrigue.  Whenever possible, she prefers to use subtler means to achieve her goals and is in the habit of maintaining a large number of schemes and plots all over the Six Realms.

As he grew older, he'd start to pick up hangers on or even force people to follow his orders with threats and his growing reputation.  When his sister suggested that they work together to grab even more power for themselves, he was eager to join her.  Although he appears brutish and impulsive, there is a powerful intellect behind his eyes that now leads the Bloodmeen underground.
