"From his vantage point on a nearby hill, Rowan looked down upon the village, nestled in a hummock of land near the grim, misty expanse of the swamps."
"It was a small huddle of turf-thatched dwellings, some on wooden stilts, a community of peat miners that was clearly a miserable and downtrodden place at the best of times (which these weren't)."
"Light flickering in the haze of the swamps nearby caught Rowan's eye - there seemed to be a congregation down there, gathered near a large fire. He slowly descended into the wet to take a closer look."
"Half a dozen women, middle-aged and dressed in ragged robes, stood in a circle on a small heath. The bonfire leapt into the sky from a hollow nearby. One, face obscured by hood and a horned animal skull, thrust her skinny arms at the sky."

cov "As the light of Solance fails, as the laws of men and elf fail, we turn back to the old ways for succour, those which lie like a bedrock beneath all else. As our folk did before us, in times of need. As their folk did before them."

"The rest of the congregation uttered some harsh, guttural response as one."

cov "They knew, as we know, that the wetlands are a gateway to the lands of black eternity. We mutilated and disparaged this place when the lights of other Gods shone... now we crawl to it and beg when those lights are all extinguished, and our children starve."
cov "The old ways are eternal. But they are also unforgiving."

"As Rowan watched, a young man stepped forward from beyond the bonfire. Dressed only in filthy trousers, his limbs trembled and his face was creased with fear... but he walked into the circle of women of his own accord."
"One of the women stepped to his side, stone knife in hand."

cov "How may we prove our need? Our will to renew our bonds with the Underneath, and have It forgive us our trespasses?"
cov "The price is eternal. The blood of innocence."

        "The interruption startled the coven into silence, and Rowan leaped out onto the heath and snatched the stone knife out of the would-be sacrificer's hand."
        ro "Barbaric rituals aren't going to save your village. And nobody has to starve! My army will march through here soon, and if you surrender, you shall come under my protection."
        cov "You? Who subvert the will of the very land you seek to tyrannise? We may as well submit to a rampaging boar! The Underneath has turned from us in disgust - you've ruined us all!"
        cov "Get thee from our sight, cursed one, and 'ware sending your soldiers against our homes. We shall drown them in the air!"
        "The young man scrambled to his feet and ran into the mists, flashing a fearful look behind him as he went - whether at his rescuer or the women, it was impossible to tell."
        "Rowan felt dire, crawling energy worming its way towards the raised hands of the skull-headed witch, and he hastily retreated back to his former vantage point."
        "Diplomacy was no longer an option - the only question was whether to capture this bleak village, or destroy it."

                "The leader gesticulated at the orc vanguard bearing down on them; the orcs yelled, then screamed in fear as the air around them twisted and pulsed with awful, dank light."
                "From where Rowan was stood, the colors of their flesh and armor seemed to run together with the land like a ruined painting."
                "The skull-headed witch howled in triumph - and then was flung to the ground as an arrow punched into her midriff. Rowan's soldiers easily broke through the peasant line and slaughtered the rest of the coven in a fearful fury."
