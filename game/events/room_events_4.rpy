"Rowan awoke to the sound of sheets ruffling slightly. Helayna was in bed next to him, fast asleep. She must have been tossing in her sleep."
"He sat up and looked down at her sleeping form. The curve of her body, the way her hair streamed down her shoulders."
"Earlier, the two had talked once more about her desire to be more helpful to him. In recent weeks he really had been considering her request. He’d trained with her, but he’d also tested her like Jezera had told him too."
"He still couldn’t escape her words to him."

je "The only way to make her happy is to make her your slave."

"But, was that really true?"
"One option would be to listen to Jezera. Accept that her brain had been entirely rewired and put her into a role more fit for a woman constantly sexually charged. Perhaps even indulge in some of the vices Jezera was suggesting…"
"...Or he could listen to Helayna and try to train her back up. It might be a long road, but her devotion to him was total. If anyone in the world could help her re-learn to fight it would be him."
"And as Rowan sat there, eyeing the rise and fall of his lover’s chest, he came to an answer."

"No response. He knocked again."

je "Oh. Rowan."

"She flashed a grin."

je "Are we finally at the stage of our relationship where you come crawling to me in the middle of the night now?"
je "That little red head in your bed must not be happy about this."

"She tilted her body to the side, making it hard for Rowan not to notice her nudity and the sexy curves that nudity revealed."

je "But then again, since you still roll about with your original little red head around, she can’t be too surprised."
je "Not that I mind, of course. Come in."

"Rowan followed Jezera into her lavish quarters. As he did, he couldn’t help but notice a lump on her bed under the covers. He couldn’t tell, though, if it was a masculine or feminine state. With his mind more concerned by Helayana, he didn’t care enough to check further."
"Rowan took a step forward and shook his head."

ro "Not tonight, Mistress. I’m actually here to talk about that same red head. You gave me advice about her before. About what she could become. I wanted to talk about that."


"The moment he said it, the wicked grin melted from her face."

je "That’s what you’re at my door in the lover’s hour about?"
je "Oh hero, you can be such a disappointment sometimes."

"She shook her head at him, clearly disappointed. She snapped her fingers, and at once her normal red dress materialized on her body."

"Rowan stood still and in an attentive pose. Like it or not, Jezera held all the power in their relationship. He needed to be respectful."

je "No no. I’m awake now. We might as well make something of it."
je "Tell me what you arrived at. Did you take my advice?"

"Rowan coughed. Count on Jezera to get right to the most sexual element of a conversation."

ro "Well, I wanted to see if you were right for myself first."
ro "I sparred with her out in the courtyard. She still has great potential as a fighter, but the ring dangerously distracts her. She struggles to maintain concentration for more than a short length of time. It will take a lot of work before she she is competent as a fighter again."
ro "And I tried your...suggestions...in bed. Once more you were right. She’s inexperienced with the matter, but she seemed to enjoy a more servile role. If I wanted to make her my bed slave, I believe she would not protest too hard."

"Jezera rolled her eyes."

je "The fact that I’m right is hardly news. I usually am. So now that you’ve run your little tests, what are you going to do about it?"

"Rowan looked down at his feet."

je "Excellent excellent, I knew you’d see the wisdom of my words."

"Rowan nodded. The fact that choosing this appeased Jezera was only a bonus. Still, he had to be careful. The fact alone that Jezera wanted him to do it put Rowan on edge. She was almost certainly scheming something."

je "Head over heels for you. New to submission. Sexually addicted, but inexperienced. "

"She put a hand to her chin."

je "Your first step is train her in the basics of obedience and being on bottom. You must get her used to the idea of being compliant to your commands until it’s second nature."
je "If you start with the lighter stuff first, she won’t balk later on when you give her more and more demanding commands."
je "Focus on positive feedback. Keep on reminding her over and over again that she’s helping you by being obedient."

"He raised an eyebrow."

ro "Positive feedback is how you turn someone into a slave?"

je "A willing slave? It’s the most important part. Or at least, stringing them along with little bits of it so that they jump along for more and more. Discipline when needed, of course. But, you’re trying to coax her into submission, not beat her into it."
je "That fact is what makes my dear brother such a complete oaf. He can be manipulative when he really wants to be. But, most of the time he has the delicacy of a minotaur in a glass workshop."

"Jezera snapped and sat up in her chair. Her body was electric with excitement."

je "Actually, I have something on hand that might be useful in this situation."

"Jezera rushed over to a shelf. Rowan looked towards her bed. The lump moved slightly, but he still could not see the figure underneath. When Jezera returned, she tossed an ornate box on his lap."
"Inside was a leather collar with a metal ring bolted to the front. It had frills around the edges in a deep crimson."

je "Hrmmm."

"Jezera snapped again. Before his very eyes, the color of the material shifted into an exact match to the bedwear she had taken to wearing around."

je "There we are. Have to make it match that little purple number she trounces about in."

"Rowan glanced up at Jezera and then back at the collar."

ro "Magic?"

"He picked it up. Normal weight. Normal thickness. Yet, it almost certainly was laced with any number of enchantments."

ro "What does it do?"

je "Collars are about ownership, aren’t they? We put collars on dogs to show other people who they belong to. And since this particular dog is also another person…"

"She giggled cruelly."

je "It’s the result of an experiment of mine. I’m not sure how easily I could whip up another one. But, while it’s around her neck it should induce a feeling of belonging and it should center her thoughts even stronger on the person who put it there."
je "I don’t know how it would interact with the ring. But, I suspect it would allow you to further shape her lust towards your own ends."

"Rowan stared down at the collar. Such an effect would of course be helpful. But, it wouldn’t exactly be out of Jezera’s wheelhouse to include some other effect that was less obvious in the background."

ro "That’s all it will do? No transformations? No remote mind control?"

je "My dear hero, would I ever lie to you?"

"Rowan put the collar back in the box. He probably would give it to Helayna. It could easily have another enchantment, but if Jezera wanted to force another enchantment on Helayna, it was hardly as though she’d need to resort to this trickery."
"Jezera had a few more pointers. Indeed, she was practically brimming with excitement at the possibility of teaching Rowan the tricks of the trade." 
"But, before long he was starting to nod off. It was still late at night after all. A yawn convinced them that this was a conversation that could be resumed another time. When Rowan left Jezera’s room, he took the box with him."

ro "Really, I’m as much a...voyeur of that situation as you are."

ro "I already knew that. But, I also know something else. You are the most powerful enchantress in this castle. Perhaps among the most powerful alive in the world."

"She laughed to herself, but he could see in her eyes that the flattery had been effective. Jezera’s vanity was one bedrock he could count on."

ro "Maybe you can’t do anything about the ring. But, if you tried you could come up with something to help her regain her focus. An entirely different enchantment. If not a way to free her from her lust, then to forestall it."

ro "I wish to ensure that one of the most effective soldiers in the realm can take a spot at the head of your armies. Surely you understand why I would desire this, Mistress."

je "Mhm. One of the most effective soldiers….and one who wishes for nothing less then my head on a pike. Would you empower my enemies, Rowan?"

"She straightened up in her chair, and matched him eye to eye. He’d have to step carefully here."

ro "Never. I wish only for...well, I’ve developed quite strong feelings for Helayna. Surely, you can understand why I want this for her. If that means I will keep her in check, then I can do that."

je "Very well. I don’t have the brain power for these shenanigans at this hour."
je "So long as you keep the faith, I will provide you with a means to help her focus better in combat. It will help, but you think you can slap one enchantment on her and call it a day, then you don’t understand enchantments."
je "Granted, you don’t understand enchantments anyway."

"She waved off Rowan sharply. As she did, the outfit she’d manifested dematerialized into the air. Rowan didn’t dawdle though. For all the annoyance Jezera had shown, she’d still agreed to help him and that was what mattered."

"That was when he sunk down to his knees, placing himself eye level to Helayna’s eager sex. She kept her legs spread and didn’t lean forward. Still he could feel her eyes follow him with eager interest."

hel "My love, you know I haven’t..."

"That was when he planted his tongue between her legs, quickly finding the hood of her clit. She let out a small gasp, but was otherwise obedient. Her posture held."

hel "Oh."

"After that it was a matter of work her slowly. This was not exactly the first pussy Rowan had eaten, and he knew what he was doing. He started with small movements at a slow and steady pace, to work her into it."
"But, once she was used to the pace, he picked it up. The pressure placed on her clit by the motion of his tongue only grew by the second. She let out a mewling noise, but still kept her composure."

hel "Ooooooh."

"The seconds turned to minutes. Rowan tasted her with all the pungent flavour that she gave off. His tongue brushed against her folds, taking in their texture..taking in the unique shape of her body."
"While at first her discipline had been solid, it soon started to crack. He felt a shake run up her leg, and was certain her posture was starting to slouch."

"Rowan leaned backwards, away from her soaked pussy. Indeed, it seemed that she was doing worse then he’d feared. Not only was her entire body shaking, but one of her hands had drifted down to her side."

hel "M-my love...I..."

"The look of ecstasy on her face suggested she was finding it hard to focus on his earlier command. That would not do." 
"He reached around her body and planted a hard slap on her rear. The blow sounded out through the room, along with Helayna’s surprised gasp."

ro "Posture. You have to remember your posture. I told you to say still."

"Helayna bit her lip, but rushed to bring her hand back behind her leg. Her cheeks burned with shame."

"It was only once Rowan had made sure that she straightened her posture that Rowan resumed the task of getting her off. Whatever relief that the pause had granted, was erased almost immediately by the sensual assault of his tongue to her sex."

hel "Fuckkk."

"His tongue arched and flared in her folds. He could full the extent of the effect on her. She was shaking. He could feel it even between her legs. Her entire body from her forehead to her clit was doing it."
"The loudest sound in the room was her breathing. It had started to come out as shallow pants, punctuated by intense gasps and moans."
"She was getting close. Everything about her reactions seemed to suggest that if he kept going just a little bit further, she would cum. Which is why he stopped."

hel "Huh?"

"Rowan stood up to meet Helayna eye to eye. She let out a long and frustrated groan. Hearing it gave Rowan’s heart strange butterflies."

hel "What? But, I was right about to cum…"

"Rowan leaned in close to his lover and whispered softly in her ear."

ro "You’re going to cum when I cum. Not before."

"She bit down on her lip and nodded softly."

hel "Does that mean, you’re about to fuck me?"

ro "I am. But, there’s one thing first."
ro "I need you to go on the bed, place your hands directly on top of the head board, and stick your ass out. Can you do that for me?"

"She nodded softly."

hel "If you insist, my love."

"He watched her saunter over to the bed, swaying her ass back and forth with each step. It wasn’t subtle at all. She was calling him over to take her."

"Rowan made his way back to the cabinet he’d drawn the collar from. His clothes were thrown off piece by piece on the way there."

ro "Just hold still. I’ll be right there."

"He pulled out something else he’d stashed away for this occasion. A bit of rope from the supply shed. Helayna shot a curious look over her shoulder, but demurred when she saw him returning."

hel "Afraid I’m going to escape?"

"Rowan put a hand on her thigh, letting it slowly glide up and down. Her skin was so incredibly soft. It was almost surreal."

ro "No. I just want to hold you…"

"He set to work on her hands, binding them to the head board."

ro "Right in place."

"She wiggled her rear and tested the bonds he was working on. Rowan’s skills with rope were purely practical from his army days. But, the utilitarian knots he learned from his army days worked here. Mostly."
"Helayna winced."

ro "Are you alright?"

hel "Yeah. Just a little tight over there."

"Rowan loosened the knot where she specified and kept going. Helayna let out small sounds every so often. Grunts while testing her bonds or little sighs signaling her impatience."

ro "There we are."

"He leaned back, surveying his work and his prize. Helayna was kneeling on the beg near naked and pulsing with need. The ring on her new collar jingled softly. Her hands remained firmly bound to the headboard by clumsy but effective knots. Rowan smiled."

hel "You have me right where you want me, my love. Please. Please. Just take me already. Fuck me. I’m begging you."

"If she insisted."

"Her pleading was cut silent by the sudden intrusion of Rowan’s cock into her. Her words were cut off by a sharp gasp. He shoved himself deep into her folds, taking little time to warm up. Her pussy was soaked and already more than ready for something a bit harder."

hel "Yes. Yes. Yes."

"Rowan grunted and slammed into her with all of the might he could muster. Her body squirmed under him, but her movement was limited by her bindings. All she could do was energetically take his cock."
"Her words drifted off into an incoherent string of yelps and cries."
"He could see the way that lacking free movement, her fingernails dug into the headboard." 
"There was a special way Helayna moved when she was fucked. The moment a cock entered her, her arms would flex, and her body would shake. Everything turned to movement and energy. Yet this explosive energy crashed into her bindings." 
"It wasn’t like Rowan had much time to reflect on that. Where she’d been the first to throw herself entirely into it, Rowan’s studying demeanor broke entirely and now he was just in the moment. Rising the wave of pleasure as he plunged in again and again and again."
"They both threw themselves into the consumptive ecstasy."

hel "Fuck. Fuck. I’m close. I can’t hold it. I can’t hold it."

ro "Then cum with me."

"True to his word, Rowan came a moment later. A shot of pleasure went up his spine, like electricity through his system. As he stiffened, whatever resolve Helayna had left simply vanished. She jerked widely, held down only by the rope and let out a long screech."

"The last few spasms played out even as the two settled down. Rowan lazily went to the ropes, and rather than bother untying it, just freed her with a quick dagger cut. Even while rubbing her wrists, she was already burrowing into him like a cat."
"Wrapped in each other’s arms and each other’s warmth, they started to drift slightly."

hel "Did I do good? Did I do what I was supposed to do?"

"Rowan brushed her cheek."

ro "You were amazing, love. You’re wonderful."

"They continued to drift more towards rest. From the corner of his eyes, Rowan saw her brushing her fingertips along the edge of the collar. She would be happy with all of this. He was sure of it."
