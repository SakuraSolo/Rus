"During Rowan's survey of this hilly region, he was fortunate enough to stumble on an exposed vein of iron. While nothing terribly large, it was definitely worth exploiting."
"He charted a route to reach it and reported the details to Jezera so she could set up a small mining expedition. The operation would be so small that no special arrangements would be needed to get a little extra iron into the castle's supply."
"Small boons like this could make all the difference during the early days of Bloodmeen's restoration."
"Later on, it would be unlikely that Rowan would bother with the effort and paperwork as the minor benefits simply wouldn't be worth it."
