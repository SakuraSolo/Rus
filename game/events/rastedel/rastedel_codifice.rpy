"Rowan had never been in the main sanctuary of the Grand Codifice when it was empty before. This place was only open to the public on worship days. He’d never truly gotten a chance to study its beauty."
"Sweeping marble arches lined the walls. All leading up to a great dome at the top. Everything here was ancient. Ageless stone chairs, carvings in the walls from ancient days. The only element he knew was recent were the gardens of flowers lining the sides."
"An old beauty."
"There was the sound of gentle rhythmic humming in a female voice. A sweet, kindly melody. A mother’s prayer."

"Then pure magic happened. When most people pray, the gods above give no sign of having listened. Not so for a High Arbitron."
"The crystal pools at the base of the raised dais responded to the waves of her voice. They danced and waved to the sounds. Rowan stood back, in amazement. Droplets started to rise in the air before his very eyes."
"Her pitch went higher, and with it went the water. No longer droplets, but a stream rose into the air like a geyser. It went higher and higher until even reached the dome roof, eventually rising through holes in the ceiling. "
"Another key change. Her voice flooded the hall. It reverberated through the dome. Everywhere it struck was illuminated. A sound that was itself a light."
"The streams only grew and grew. Soon they had become inverted waterfalls. Rising with the force and power that water normally falls. The High Arbitron’s light shimmered and reflected in the suspended water. They sparkled in the light."
"When the hymn came to an end, the room fell back into an empty gloom. But, the magic stayed. The water continued to flow upwards all around the platform, in their unnatural stream. Just how Rowan remembered them."

mari "A little bird told me I would have a visitor today. But, she didn’t say it would be one as important as you, dear hero."

"Marianne strode down the steps of the platform, arms outstretched as if to embrace him. Rowan went down to one knee."

ro "I am unworthy, Your Beatitude."

mari "I should hope not."
mari "Will you sit with me?"

"She walked over to the pews, and took a seat on one of the old stone benches. Rowan hurried to follow her and sit at her side. They were alone in the room, save for one single inquisitorial guard standing in the doorway."
"Not that she needed any guard. Rowan knew full well that no swordsman alive would be any match for the magic of a Prothean High Priest."

ro "I heard about the disaster in Astarte. I turned my horse around and made double time for the city the moment I heard."

mari "That is most dutiful of you. Everyone knows that Rowan Blackwell is the realms’ staunchest defender."
mari "I will be honest with you. The city needs it. Not since the war has the danger been greater."
mari "Are the good folk aware of the danger in the outlying provinces? My heart aches for them."

"Rowan had to stop himself from chuckling. He hadn’t exactly checked."

ro "Yes, at least where I was last. A new demon war is a hard thing to ignore."

mari "Indeed."

"She looked off to the side. Rowan wondered if she’d address what had happened when he last came to court. She had refused his request for aid then."

ro "You called for my presence, Your Beatitude? Is there something you desire of me?"

mari "Nothing besides helping in my small way. It is well known you’ve been important in fighting the invaders in the field. Please allow me to give you my blessing of protection."

"Rowan bowed slightly."

ro "It would be my honour."

"Marianne put a hand on top of his head. Her fingers were so soft and warm. They bathed him soft light."

    "When the light faded, Rowan felt...odd. It wasn’t a bad sensation. Almost like he was cloaked in weightless armour. He could feel it, even if he couldn’t see it. At least until the blessing ended, he’d be a more formidable threat."

ro "Thank you. I understand how rare a gift this is to receive."

mari "It’s a gift well earned. Of course, I should be the one thanking you."

"Rowan rose to his feet slowly, and gave another short bow. There were so many rules and rituals for dealing with a High Arbitron."

ro "I must be on my way. My liege, Duke Reave is surely waiting for me."

"Marianne let him walk a few steps before finally speaking up."

mari "Please wait a moment."
mari "There is one other thing that I wish to treat with you about."

"Rowan stopped and turned. He betrayed no signs that he’d been waiting for this moment ever since he walked in."

mari "You of all people understand better than most that the current situation we’re in is...distressing. This city is filled with good people. Pious people. It is quite a shock to learn that hardship and war is closer than anticipated."

ro "I tried to warn you before."

"Marianne didn’t flinch or shy away from the question."

mari "A noble effort. I should have understood that Solansia herself was speaking through you. I hope you understand that I sympathized with what you were saying."
mari "I told the Baron as much, but he did not even need my counsel. His great concern for the people of the provinces was what convinced him of the need to act."
mari "We must look to the future and what can be done, there is no time for regrets."

ro "Indeed. The defense of the city…"

mari "That, I have no fears about. Our commanders are brave and bold. Veterans of the last war all. But, more than that, we have the heavens to protect us. Solansia will not let her children suffer. "

"Rowan’s eyebrows scrunched. How could she say that after…"

mari "It is the souls of the people I fret for. They live in terror. Except for services, they have been staying indoors. Talking and muttering about themselves. I have sent out my best and brightest shepherds to tend to the flock, but more is required."
mari "The people must truly believe that Solansia is protecting them. They must be shown that their fears are misplaced."

ro "How do you propose to do that, if I may be so bold as to ask?"

show marianne happy at center with dissolve

"Marianne let out an angelic giggle."

mari "That is why I am speaking to you specifically on the matter. "
mari "When all seemed darkest in the past, you were the realm’s light. Solansia’s children believe in you, because you were her vessel. "
mari "Surely even knowing that you are standing shoulder to shoulder with our defenders will remind them that she still watches over us all."
mari "That is why I wanted you to be the guest of honour at this week’s upcoming sermon. The Lady’s children should see you, prepared to act on her behalf. It would do much to aid many troubled minds."

"Rowan scratches his head."

ro "That’s it? You just want me to come on stage during the next sermon?"

mari "It is to be a start, not an end. There will be many grave days ahead for the people of Rastedel. They must see you alongside our defences constantly. They must believe their guardians are strong, because you are with them."

ro "So I’d be almost like a flag?"

mari "Yes. The flag of victory. My flag."

"Perhaps this was a valuable offer. Jezera had commanded him to bring down the city, and a position of influence would help him with that. The problem was, Rowan wasn’t all too sure that what she was describing was a real position of influence."
"The smartest option would be to wait and to confer with Ameraine. She had a better sense of Marianne’s goals then he did."

ro "With all due respect to Your Beatitude, may I take some time to consider it?"

"Marianne's smile didn’t crack, but there was a small flicker in her eyes. "

mari "Your country needs you and you wish to take time to consider it?"

ro "Some, yes. I’ve been on the road many days straight, and I have yet to even report to my liege lord. I have not had time to consider the situation."

mari "Of course, then. Please rest. You must have a colossal weight on your shoulders. I will happily wait for your reply."
mari "But, remember. Together we can do great things for the Rosarian people. Much good."

"Rowan silently bowed once more and made his way down the stone steps of the sanctuary. He couldn’t see Marriane’s face. Would she take this as a slight?"

"As Rowan walked out of the sanctuary, he heard the sound of someone running towards him."

quest "Sir? Sir? I was told to deliver this to you."

"A small boy rushed over to Rowan, and slipped a sheet of paper into his hands. He vanished before Rowan even had a chance to ask what it was."
"It was a note from Ameraine. Of course, she had already heard that he had come to the city. It seemed that word traveled fast as a colt here in the city. She wanted to meet at some inn named “The Rat Ship” down by the riverside."

ro "Hmmmm."

"At The Rat Ship, Rowan found himself in the middle of a lively tavern. The streets may have been quiet, but there was no way the bars would be. Men and women drank heartily. There was one topic of conversation."

man "My brother left for the countryside the other day. There are more Orcs out there, but at least they aren’t heading in that direction."

aman "We don’t know they’re coming here."

man "Still, the time to get out of the city is right now. I’ve got a wagon, the journey wouldn’t be so bad."

"Something was concerning Rowan though. He was being watched."
"A well dressed man in the corner of the bar was nursing a pint, but his eyes never seemed to leave Rowan, from the moment Rowan walked in. No one sat around him. He was just sitting there, watching. Perhaps he recognized Rowan."
"Still, it was concerning."
"Rowan approached the bar to ask about Ameraine. Only, he didn’t even make it that far in the conversation."

bwom "Oh, you’re Mr. Redstream, aincha ya? I was told to look for a man all dressed in leathers and weapons. Brown hair. Good looking. Very good looking."

ro "Told by whom?"

bwom "Ach. Did I say told? I don’t recall that. Anyway, your room is waiting for you. Your servant paid for it in advance."

ro "..."
ro "Excellent. Thank you."

"Rowan gave one last glance to the man in the corner, before ascending the stairs. Did he know that he was here to meet Ameraine?"

"The room itself was spartan. A desk, a bed, and a window. Its sole virtue was lots of space. He could entertain guests here, provided they weren’t too put off by the lack of chairs."
"His first guest arrived shortly after he did."

"Ameraine strolled into the room, her heels clicking on the wooden floor with each step. The slight frame and pale skin could only belong to one person. 

Her face was unobscured, the first time he’d seen it unmasked in natural light. It was only...softer...then he had thought it would be."

amer "Like the accommodations? They aren’t luxurious but they are discreet."

"Rowan lowered his head softly in a respectful bow."

ro "Good evening, M’lady. I’ve slept far worse places. This is more than sufficient for me."
ro "Are you sure no one knows about this place, though? Someone was watching me downstairs."

amer "Someone was watching you? Hrmm. I’ll look into that."

"Rowan settled on the bed and offered Ameraine the desk. She approached it with a dignified sashay and used its raised surface as a stool. She kept her legs crossed as she sat."
"Rowan suppressed a smirk. If there was a difference between Ameraine and Jezera, it’s that Jezera never would have crossed her legs."

amer "I heard you spoke to our good High Arbitron. If Jacques and Duke Werden don’t already know, I’m sure they will soon."

ro "She wanted me to be the guest of honour at her next sermon. She implied some further role else after that as well."

amer "Of course, she does. I’d turn her down if I were you."

"Rowan raised an eyebrow."

ro "A role with her would put me near the city’s defences, wouldn’t it?"
ro "Why wouldn’t I want that?"

"In truth, he’d been leaning towards turning her down himself, but it was for a reason that he could quite put into words. "

amer "Two things. First, she doesn’t actually want to give you real power. You’re as much of a threat to her as anyone else really. You bring your own following with you, and that’s as dangerous to her as it is helpful after all."
amer "Second, Marianne is probably not going to be a source of power for too much longer…"

"That got Rowan’s attention. As far as he knew, the faithful of Solansia and the Baron had always ruled the realm together. Was she about to be replaced as High Arbitron?"

ro "I will never understand the politics of this place…"

"Lady Ameraine chuckled to herself."

amer "Oh, you will soon. For the immediate future, it’s going to be your life."
amer "Since you left, the pressure on Marianne to do something about Raeve Keep has been mounting. The return of our dear Duke helped with that. She needed to do something about the problem, or else risk her position. "

ro "Thus the battle?"

amer "Thus the battle."

"Rowan nodded."

amer "The long knives are out for her now. Nothing costs legitimacy more than defeat in the field."
amer "She doesn’t know the extent of it, but she must be aware that Jacques and Duke Werden wouldn’t leave a situation like this untouched. In the next few weeks, anyone could be in power."

ro "The High Arbitron has been the most important minister of state for as long as anyone can remember."

amer "Yes yes yes. But, they’ve also always had an army or high reputation for as long as anyone can remember. Power must come from somewhere, Rowan. Either from real swords or imaginary swords. Right now, Marianne has neither."
amer "Everyone can lose power."

"Rowan rose from his seat and put his hands on the windowsill. Beneath him, the river steadily pushed onward. The first news of the battle must have come this way. Bloated bodies floating into town."

ro "So Marianne is on the brink of losing power, and the Coppers and the Purples are both planning to push that along."
ro "Where do we fit into this?"

"Ameraine smiled."

amer "Right in the middle."
amer "If someone knocks Marianne out of power, that’s going to cause some chaos. And, I’m sure you’ve noticed, but if there is a side that thrives when it comes to chaos, it’s ours. For your dear masters, chaos is home."

"Rowan shook his head."

ro "...Why would Werden be so stupid though? Infighting with the enemy at the gates."

amer "That’s an awfully trusting thing to say about the man. I wasn’t aware you had so much affection for him."

ro "I don’t."

if avatar.corruption > 60:
    ro "It’s just that he isn’t that stupid. Surely, he understands that fighting with his own side will strengthen the collective effort against him."
    ro "He’s a more dangerous foe than that. You must be underestimating him."

    ro "I had known that the city’s guardians were…"
    ro "I...Hrmmm…"
    ro "I know that they’re all ineffective. But, surely they have to be smart enough not to stab themselves in the foot in a situation like this. They can’t be this stupid. It’s impossible."

else:
    ro "I just...I don’t think you’re right. About him or Jacques. Yes, the city is in trouble, but it will take more than that to bring it down. Werden, Marianne, and the rest are formidable enemies. We’re going to have to be smarter than that."
    ro "I just refuse to believe it."

"Ameraine listened to it without breaking a smile. But, her silence betrayed very little regard for what he was saying here. It was condescending."

amer "Well, believe whatever you like. I’m sure you’ll be able to get a clearer picture of the situation the longer you’re here. I don’t expect you to trust me. Hell, you’d have to be pretty dumb to trust me."

ro "...Right."

show rowan necklace neutral at midleft with dissolve

ro "So what do you believe is the next step then?"

amer "We need to figure out who the easiest figure to subvert is. Subverting the city’s defences are one thing. But, if we can actually put a friend in the big chair...well that just makes victory trivial, doesn’t it?"
amer " Someone who would not only, be easy to overcome, but who would actively work to bring the city into the hands of your masters. Easily controlled with."

ro "Perhaps replace one of the leaders with some kind of shape shifting…"

"Ameraine swatted the idea out of the air with her hand."

amer "Thought of that already. Why do you think this is so difficult? Your shape shifting friends are good at taking on a form, but probably couldn’t pretend to be someone else forever. You can copy a face easier then you can copy a brain."
amer "We’re going to have to install a leader that is amenable to us from those we already have."
amer "Werden is a no go on that front. He’d sooner snap than bend. I don’t think either of us could even persuade him what to eat for dinner."

"The most intractable foe of the twins…though the one that might draw the most questions if he were to attempt to deal with."

if avatar.corruption < 31:
    "Though perhaps the most likely to limit or even counter whatever they intend to do…."
    
amer "Then we have our friends, Jacques and the Coppers. By all accounts, you wouldn’t find a nobleman with less desire to maintain the status quo. And quite rational. He won’t have a knee jerk negative reaction to the offer of alliance. He’s a possibility."
amer "But, I’ve had the fortune of spending a bit more time with him than most. If you speak to him, you might pick it up too. He’d be less amenable to a demonic regime then you might suspect. He’s a possibility but not a recommendation."

"The Coppers were interested in making changes to the old order and allowing more people who deserved it to rise through the ranks. A deal with them could spare the capital of all kinds of bloodshed."

ro "But, aren’t those the two men best placed to take power from Marianne."

amer "You’re still not understanding power properly. They’ve got the most swords, but it’s not like those swords just vanish outside of their hands."
amer "Patricia Crevette. You’ve met her, I recall. She made a fascinating show of herself during your audience with the Baron."
amer "I’ve been watching her for quite some time. She might be...amenable to serving new masters. I’m sure that your friends up north would be very happy to see her on the throne."

ro "Patricia Crevette... The Chancellor?"

amer "Red hair. A bit pudgy. You remember her."

"His eyes brushed over Ameraine’s frame. Compared to her, everyone was pudgy."

amer "Anyway, those are the options I see. Ask around. Let it be known that you’re looking for friends in town. You don’t have any soldiers, but you do have your name. Names can be a valuable commodity. People kill for them. People die for them."

ro "So that’s the plan then. We find an ally, help them take over, and then induce them to surrender the city without fighting."

    "Rowan’s fingers dug into the windowsill slightly. If there was one responsibility he had, it was making sure that any fall of the city didn’t turn into a massacre like what happened on Astarte."
    "If the gates were open when the demons arrived, even Andras would be forced to calm his rage. But, otherwise there was a chance of something truly terrible happening."

"Rowan turned to face Ameraine."

ro "Why? What are you getting from all of this?"

amer "Oh come now, Rowan. You must know that a man who brazenly asks for secrets is a lot like a hero from back in olden times."

ro "Brave?"

amer "Dead."

"With that, Ameraine slid gracefully from the desk and made a motion towards the door."

ro "Guess no time to sit around and get to know each other, huh?"

amer "Just the opposite. We’re going to be spending a lot of time together, Rowan. No need to rush things."

show ameraine neutral at midright with dissolve

amer "Remember, take some time to ask around. And when you’ve found the cock you want to place your bet on, just call for me. You have only to leave a note for me with Sarah, down at the desk. She’ll know where to send it."

"She stopped one more time at the door, suddenly turning and meeting his eyes. Her pupils were a deep black pit. Easy to fall into."

amer "And Rowan? If you spill a word about your situation, I will know about it. So no squealing."
amer "Welcome back to Rastedel. This time, you’re in for a longer stay."

"With that she closed the door, leaving Rowan alone in the room with his thoughts."
