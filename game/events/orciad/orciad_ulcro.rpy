"After giving a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness of the tent, the leader of this horde of orcs came into vision."
"Sitting on a throne of sorts was an older orc, covered in scars and missing an eye. He was slouched down, but watched the new arrival with great intensity. Rowan could tell at once that this was a veteran of many battles, like himself."
"Even though Ulcro was maintaining every appearance of being calm and uninterested, the human could see how tense his muscles were, how he was holding his axe in such a way that it could be brought to bare in an instance, if necessary."

ro "I bring you greetings from Bloodmeen, great warlord Ulcro."

ulc "Rowan. Tell me, what's a great hero of humans doing as a demon's messenger?"

"So, the warchief knew who Rowan was. Given his age and rank, it should have been more surprising if he hadn't. The hero admonished himself silently, then changed plans."

ro "Someone important to me was taken away. We humans can be a bit, sentimental."

"To Rowan's surprise, the orc actually chuckled and seemed to relax!"

ulc "A year ago I wouldn't have understood, now I do. My heart has been stolen by a woman I cannot please. Rowan, help me reach my beloved's heart like she has taken mine and I will gladly serve your master."

"This was the third time that the orc's words had surprised Rowan and this time he wasn't able to keep it from showing on his face."

ulc "Do not be so surprised. Orcs can love too. My lovely lady lost her home and now I want to give her a new one."

ro "The human woman that Batri's raiders found?"

"The chief spat on the ground."

ulc "That bastard almost did unspeakable things to my love. She is no mere woman, she is of noble blood. Though this is also a part of my troubles with her, it is a trouble I intend to overcome for her sake."

ro "Can talk to her? Is she in your tent?"

ulc "No. She isn't here or in any of my commander's tents. She is hidden away somewhere safe, it isn't your place to see her."

ro "Well then, can you at least tell me what exactly is the problem?"

"Ulcro waved his arms around the room."

ulc "This!  An orc camp isn't a place for a noblewoman! She doesn't have proper beds, proper clothes, or proper food! I want to convince her I can give her just as good a life as she had back in her family's home."
ulc "I don't care if you steal, buy, or even make those treasures for her, just bring them to me! If you need a raiding party I will provide you one, but I refuse to let this army go anywhere until my love accepts me!"
ulc "Then, and only then, will your master get his soldiers."

ro "I understand.  It was an honor to meet you, warchief."

"Ulcro merely gave a dismissive wave, done with the hero for the time being."
